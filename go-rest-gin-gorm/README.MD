A really simple API now with Gin


### Dependencies

- GIN (github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
 - Playing around with a proper web framework instead of doing everything manually as the previous study

- GORM (ORM + Driver) (gorm.io/gorm + gorm.io/driver/postgres) 

- Validator (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10)
   - Course suggestion was go get gopkg.in/validator.v2, but the usage in 2025 seems to be pretty low

- Testify (go get github.com/stretchr/testify)
   - Assertions in tests
